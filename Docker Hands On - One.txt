Basic Docker Commands:
sudo docker info
sudo docker version
sudo docker -v
sudo docker --version
sudo docker help
sudo docker pull --help
sudo docker images
sudo docker images -q (to get only image ids)
sudo docker ps -a -q (to get only container ids)
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker ps
sudo docker container ls
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker pull image-name
sudo docker run image name or image-id
sudo docker pull hello-world
sudo docker run hello-world
sudo docker pull centos
sudo docker run -it centos(to run container and go within container. Type exit from there)
sudo docker tag hello-world pankajdtrainer/hello-world
sudo docker container ls -all
sudo docker ps --filter status=running
sudo docker run -d --name=pankaj-container hello-world
sudo docker stop container-id
sudo docker inspect container-id
sudo docker rm container-id
sudo docker rmi image-name

sudo docker system df - Amout of Disk Space Usage
sudo docker system  info   -     Display system-wide information
sudo docker system prune - Unused Contrainers, Images removal
sudo docker system  df    -    Show docker disk usage

Hands On - TWO

Taggging
sudo docker pull ubuntu:16.04 (Tagging)
docker container ls
docker container ls -all
docker run -it ubuntu  (You are now inside container.  Over here you can run different commands like apt-get update.  This will change image by version)

sudo docker container ls -all (will give you details about you the ubuntu container)
Now if you want to save these changes as an image then COMMIT the changes and push to docker hub.
sudo docker commit -m "did an apt-get update" -a "author name" container-id dockerhubrepository/new image name
docker login (enter credentials for docker hub)
docker push dockerhubrepository/new image name
Go to docker hub and check you image

Hands On -THREE

- In this example we will us httpd(This image only contains Apache httpd with the defaults from upstream.
There is no PHP installed, but it should not be hard to extend.  The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache,
is a Web server application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web.)
- It has mininum set of libraries to run an OS with Apache installation

-- sudo docker run -it -p 80:80 -d httpd

-it means interactive mode
-p means port. 80 is for my local port.  80 is the server mode
-d means ditatched mode or run it at the backround.

Go to the localhost:80 or to the IP address of the machine. you could see the message "It Works!". It can be accessed from different machines, different browsers. It Works!

Not time to go the container by following command

-- sudo docker exec -it containe-id(e.g 4bba8c648f59) bash

Once inside the container, type ls.  this will give you all the list of folders inside that container.
Your website is inside htdocs.  So do cd htdocs.  and then ls. You could see index.html file is present there.
try to edit this file with nano command. You will get error message "bash: nano: command not found". WHY?
Thats because httpd is has mininum set of libraries to run an OS on top of Apache installation.

So, we need to manually install nano editor.  So, first do apt-get update and install nano by
-- apt-get install nano in the container.
now if you do nano index.html, you could edit that file that has message "it Works!" to "Something Else Works!".  Now change it to something else.

Control+x and y.

Open your localhost:80 or the External IP on the same tab where GCP is open or to any other browser.  You could see you will get a new message that you typed.
Now do sudo docker stop 4bba8c648f59.  You can not access the service by the ip address now.  You can start the conainer again by sudo docker start 4bba8c648f59.

Finally Remove Container:
- sudo docker rm 4bba8c648f59 - to remove the container.
