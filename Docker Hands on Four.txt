Hands ON - FOUR
Now commands for creating a docker file, creating an image from that finally the container
mkdir abc
cd abc
gedit file-name (to create a file within that directory)
rm file-name(commands to learn remove files)
rmdir folder-name(commands to learn remove files)

1) create a folder by mkdir command and then create a Dockerfile inside it.  Add following message into that.
# getting base image from ubuntu
# if you want to build an image from scratch use FROM scratch(image in docker-hub)
FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Edureka!"

Now within folder run command
docker build -t user-defind-imagename .    (space and dot is must and this will build a docker image)

2) Now create another folder by mkdir command and then create a Dockerfile inside it.  Now add following lines into that.
# difference between RUN and CMD is that RUN gets executed during building of the image.  
# However, with CMD you can print the messases on cansole and it gets(message inside it) executed when you create a container out of that image.
FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER edureka/email (maintainer is paase' now)
LABEL edureka/email (LABEL provided metadata of docker images)
RUN apt-get update
CMD echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Edureka!"

You can run "cat Dockerfile" command to check whats inside the Dockerfile
You can run sudo docker inspect image-id

Now within folder run command
docker build -t userdefind imagename .    (space and dot is must and this will build a docker image) or if you want to add tag then
docker build -t imagename:1.0 .    (if you want to add tag to your image then add :1.0 with image name)

after execution you will get a message that successfully build (image nubmer like a663d23ds325)
"sudo docker images" command will give you details about the image you created.  Now time to run your image by command

"sudo docker run a663d23ds325"  where a663d23ds325(example image id) is the image id.  This will give you output as
Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Edureka!
