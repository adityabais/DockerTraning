-- Create a GCP ubunut machine and call it Master, or judebox or batiaon or whatever you like it.
-- Just do apt-get update to get recent packages of OS
-- Type gcloud on your machine (gcloud is a utility provided by google to access your google cloud account from your ubunutu machine)
-- To install gcloud run following command

- by defalut it will create 3 node cluser.  you can increse and decrease it while creating cluster.
