Hands On -THREE

- In this example we will us httpd(This image only contains Apache httpd with the defaults from upstream.
There is no PHP installed, but it should not be hard to extend.  The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache,
is a Web server application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web.)
- It has mininum set of libraries to run an OS with Apache installation

-- sudo docker run -it -p 80:80 -d httpd

-it means interactive mode
-p means port. 80 is for my local port.  80 is the server mode
-d means ditatched mode or run it at the backround.

Go to the localhost:80 or to the IP address of the machine. you could see the message "It Works!". It can be accessed from different machines, different browsers. It Works!

Not time to go the container by following command

-- sudo docker exec -it containe-id(e.g 4bba8c648f59) bash

Once inside the container, type ls.  this will give you all the list of folders inside that container.
Your website is inside htdocs.  So do cd htdocs.  and then ls. You could see index.html file is present there.
try to edit this file with nano command. You will get error message "bash: nano: command not found". WHY?
Thats because httpd is has mininum set of libraries to run an OS on top of Apache installation.

So, we need to manually install nano editor.  So, first do apt-get update and install nano by
-- apt-get install nano in the container.
now if you do nano index.html, you could edit that file that has message "it Works!" to "Something Else Works!".  Now change it to something else.

Control+x and y.

Open your localhost:80 or the External IP on the same tab where GCP is open or to any other browser.  You could see you will get a new message that you typed.
Now do sudo docker stop 4bba8c648f59.  You can not access the service by the ip address now.  You can start the conainer again by sudo docker start 4bba8c648f59.

Finally Remove Container:
- sudo docker rm 4bba8c648f59 - to remove the container.
