mkdir nginxtest
cd nginxtest
gedit docker-compose.yml and write your code for running two containers
just do docker-compose config to check the validity of your file.  If there is any error, it will show on the console it self
run command sudo docker-compose up -d (-d means docker daemon in detached mode).  It will leave your application running untill you decide to stop it)
check your running containers by running sudo docker ps
go to your port and check if nginx is available or not
Now time to stop running applications by command sudo docker-compose stop or docker-compose down. Check status of containers by sudo docker ps
now remove all stopped containers by command sudo docker-compose rm -f
