Both CMD & ENTRYPOINT get executed while Runtime.  ENTRYPOINT overrides CMD commands

1) create a folder by mkdir command and then create a Dockerfile inside it.  Add following message into that.
# This file has been created to understand differences b/w Entrypoint & CMD
FROM ubuntu
CMD echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Delhi, India!"

Now within folder run command
docker build -t user-defind-imagename . 

Now run command with the image created from the above build.

- sudo docker run -it image-id from the previous build
  notice the output.

Next run following command

- sudo docker run -it image-id echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Pune, India!"  
  By running this command you could see that CMD is overridden while running a container

- Next add multiple CMDs in your Dockerfile with some other messages.  Build your image again and run it again. You will notice you won't get any error,
  However, only last CMD will print the message

- Now Change your Dockerfile with ENTRYPOINT instructions
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Delhi, India!"

- And repeat previous steps and notice outputs.  Also notice your outputs if you mention both Entrypoint & CMD or Multiple Entrypoint & CMDs e.g.
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Delhi, India!"
CMD echo "Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from NewYork, US!"

- We can also use both CMD & ENTRYPOINT in Dockerfile as mentioned below:
FROM ubuntu
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hi, This is Pankaj Pandey from Delhi, India!"]

Now try to override above container image while runtime and notice the output.
