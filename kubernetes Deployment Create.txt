DEPLOYMENT
How to create DEPLOYMENT:
- vi mydeployment.yml  use akms again

-a apiVersion  (two apiversions are used v1 & extensions/v1beta1 majorly used in kubernetes)
-k kind  (Pod, Service etc)
-m metadata (metadata will have container details)
-s spec (container detailed information)

yaml use nested coding for any subfields inside a field.  That starts after two spaces.
Sample code:
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: x-container
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

- we have two spec above.  One spec gives details about the deployment. Second spec gives details about the pod
- kubectl create -f mydeployment.yml
- kubectl get deployment - You will get
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
my-deployment   5/5     5            5           3m1s

5/5 means current state/desired state

- kubectl describe deployment my-deployment
- kubectl get pods
- kubectl get deployment
All above information you can also get from the dashboard
