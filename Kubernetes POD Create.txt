- mkdir kubernetes
- cd kubernetes
- vi mypod.yml
start with to writing Kubernetes yaml file
a
k
m
s

-a apiVersion  (two apiversions are used v1 & extensions/v1beta1 majorly used in kubernetes)
-k kind  (Pod, Deployment, Service etc)
-m metadata (metadata will have container details, names, label etc)
-s spec (container level detailed information)

So, a,k & m gives info about the POD and s gives info about the container

Detailed Code is:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    anything: whatever
    version: whatevr
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80

if you want multiple containers add more containers in "spec"

How to create POD:
- kubectl create -f mypod.yml - command to create new port.
- kubectl get pods - will give details about that pod
- kubectl describe pods
- kubectl describe pod my-pod  my-pod(is name mentioned inside metadata)
This will give you all the details about that POD.  At the bottom you could see what happened at the backend.
Also go to your workloads in GCP Kubernetes Engine or to your Dashboard-PODS,you can see describe details over there as well.(in GUI Format)
